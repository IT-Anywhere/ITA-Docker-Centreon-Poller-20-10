# HINT: This configuration file contains commented EXEC lines in which,
#       as a sample, the Nagios script submit_check_result is entered.
#       In this commented calls the original MIB status values are written.
#       These status values have to be replaced by an integer 
#         0 (OK), 1 (WARNING) or 2 (CRITICAL). 
#       The placeholders <path> and <service> have to be replaced with to-be-used
#       script path resp. configured passive NAGIOS service.
#       Alternatively you may execute a different cmd. of your own choice.
